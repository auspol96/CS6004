## 👨‍🎓 Student 1: **Janarthana Kalaikumar**

### ✅ Project Outcome Summary
- Developed an application for **ABC Car Traders** using C# and Windows Forms.
- Functional implementation included:
  - Admin and Customer roles
  - CRUD for cars, car parts, customers, and orders
  - Dashboard navigation via buttons
  - Report generation
- Implemented **linear search algorithm** for part and car queries.
- Included a well-documented **reflective essay** covering architecture, class structure, search logic, and personal development.

### 🧠 Analysis
- **Strengths**:
  - Fully aligned with 2023/24 brief (correct domain)
  - Clean class-based architecture using SQL Server backend
  - Effective use of object-oriented principles
  - Detailed self-reflection and explanation of algorithms
- **Improvement areas**:
  - UI could be polished further
  - Broader variety of report types could be added
  - Better validation and exception handling would boost robustness

## 📌 Conclusion
Both students implemented functioning applications using C# and SQL in alignment with the core technical requirements.

- **Janarthana Kalaikumar** demonstrated a complete and well-documented solution aligned with all expectations.
- **S.A.H.M.N. Gunathilaka** showcased a functional system but lacked depth in documentation and algorithm discussion.

These examples can serve as:
- ✅ A **technical template** for future students
- ⚠️ A reminder to include thorough **documentation** and **reflection** per the coursework brief
