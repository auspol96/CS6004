## 📌 Conclusion
Both students implemented functioning applications using C# and SQL in alignment with the technical scope of the CS6004ES brief. Their work highlights:

- **S.A.H.M.N. Gunathilaka**: Higher performance with detailed implementation, receiving a score of **69.75**.
- **Janarthana Kalaikumar**: Functional system but lacked depth in documentation and programming quality, resulting in a lower score of **56.75**.

### 🔍 Learning Takeaways
- Follow the brief strictly, especially regarding architecture documentation and search logic.
- Always include diagrams, reflective writing, and error-handling strategies.
- Clear code commenting and naming conventions enhance maintainability.

These cases provide valuable benchmarks for current and future students aiming for full marks on the CS6004ES coursework.
