# Exercise 4: Favorite Books List (ASP.NET Core MVC)

## Objective
In this exercise, students will learn how to:
- Create a model with multiple properties
- Pass a list of objects from controller to view
- Render the list in an HTML table

---

## Expected Outcome
The webpage should display a list of favorite books in a table format, showing **Title**, **Author**, and **Publication Year**.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create a New ASP.NET Core MVC Project (if not already started)
```bash
dotnet new mvc -n FavoriteBooksApp
cd FavoriteBooksApp
```

### Step 2: Create a Model
Create a new file in the `Models` folder:

**File:** `Models/Book.cs`
```csharp
namespace FavoriteBooksApp.Models
{
    public class Book
    {
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Author { get; set; }
        public int Year { get; set; }
    }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Create Controller
Create a controller named `BooksController.cs` in the `Controllers` folder.

**File:** `Controllers/BooksController.cs`
```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using FavoriteBooksApp.Models;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace FavoriteBooksApp.Controllers
{
    public class BooksController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            var bookList = new List<Book>
            {
                new Book { Title = "To Kill a Mockingbird", Author = "Harper Lee", Year = 1960 },
                new Book { Title = "1984", Author = "George Orwell", Year = 1949 },
                new Book { Title = "The Great Gatsby", Author = "F. Scott Fitzgerald", Year = 1925 }
            };

            return View(bookList);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Step 4: Create View
Create a new Razor View `Index.cshtml` under `Views/Books/`

**File:** `Views/Books/Index.cshtml`
```razor
@model List<FavoriteBooksApp.Models.Book>

<h2>My Favorite Books</h2>

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Author</th>
            <th>Year</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var book in Model)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@book.Title</td>
                <td>@book.Author</td>
                <td>@book.Year</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

---

### Step 5: Register Route
Update `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` or home page link to point to `/Books/Index` or navigate manually to:
```
https://localhost:5001/Books
```

---

## ✅ Deliverables
When the project runs, students should see a table displaying 3 books with their titles, authors, and years.

---

## 📌 Learning Recap
- Model with multiple properties
- List of objects passed to view
- Razor syntax to loop and render table
